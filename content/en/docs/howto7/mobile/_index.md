## 1 Introduction

The Mendix vision for mobile app development is that enterprises can greatly benefit from a single platform that supports the various styles of mobile app development (web, native, and hybrid) for multiple devices and provides common mobile back-end services.

The rapid evolution of standards like HTML and the wide adoption of frameworks to bridge native device functions provide an ever-richer user experience for cross-platform apps. From a logic perspective, JavaScript is powerful as a platform-independent, back-end technology even in native clients. There is a shift occurring from native languages towards JavaScript, where JavaScript is being embedded more and more in native programming languages to raise the level of code reusability across platforms.
