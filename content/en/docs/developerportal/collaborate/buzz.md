## 1 Buzz Locations

Located in the Developer Portal, Buzz lets you see Mendix app activity in your company as well as collaborate and share ideas with your team. There are two types of **Buzz** pages: Company Buzz and App Buzz.

### 1.1 Company Buzz {#company-buzz}

The **Company Buzz is** is accessible via the top bar in the Developer Portal:

{{< figure src="/attachments/developerportal/collaborate/buzz/company-buzz.png" >}}

Under **Show activity for**, you will initially see the Buzz activity for **All** apps for which you are a team member *plus* all Buzz activity for your company. You can choose to see only activity for your company by selecting the company name (**Mendix** in the example above).

Below the company name is a list of apps for which you are a team member. Clicking the app name will take you to the [App Buzz](#app-buzz) for that app, described below.

### 1.2 App Buzz {#app-buzz}

App Buzz is Buzz for a specific app:

You can see the size of your **Team** and your fellow team members on the right side of the page. Click the **+** icon to invite new members to your team directly. Click **Show all** to go to the [Team](/developerportal/collaborate/team/) page for the app.

**Latest Stories** shows the last few stories created for this app. Click **Show all** to see all the [Stories](/developerportal/collaborate/stories/).

**App Feedback** shows the last few items of feedback for this app. Click **Show all** to see all the [Feedback](/developerportal/collaborate/feedback/).

## 2 Communicating on Buzz

By default, communication via Company Buzz can be seen by all Mendix users in the company.

You can choose to communicate with a single team by selecting the app from the **Share with** drop-down menu:

In App Buzz, you will only be communicating with team members.

### 2.1 Updating Your Status

The easiest way to communicate with others in your company and on your team is by leaving comments in Buzz. Click **Update status** to leave a new message. You can also **Add** attachments to support the discussion with your colleagues or **Edit** one of your own previous messages. You can delete your message by clicking **Edit** > **Delete**. 

To continue a conversation, you can also **Comment** on an ongoing discussion and **Like** a message to show your support.

In App Buzz, a comment can come from Mendix Studio and refer to a specific document (a page, microflow, navigation document, or the domain model). You can navigate to this document in Studio by clicking the corresponding button, such as **Show page** or **Show microflow**:
